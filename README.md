# Python tasks

## Strings

1. [Number of words in string](strings/task1/task1.py)

    Enter a string consisting of words separated by spaces. The task is to count the number of words.
    
2. [The longest string in the array](strings/task2/task2.py)

    Words separated by spaces are entered. Determine the longest word and display its number on the screen. 
    If there are several longest words, then print the numbers of all such words.
    
3. [Substring replacement](strings/task3/task3.py)

    Find the specified substring in the string and replace it with a new one. 
    The string, its substring to replace, and the new substring are entered by the user.
    
4. [Remove duplicate characters from a string](strings/task4/task4.py)

    A string is entered. The task is to remove duplicate characters and all spaces from it. 
    For example, if "abc cde def" was entered, then "abcdef" should be output.
    
5. [Remove spaces from the string and determine if it is a palindrome](strings/task5/task5.py)

    A string is entered. Remove all spaces from it. After that, determine if it is a palindrome.
    
6. [Is the string an identifier](strings/task6/task6.py)

    Determine if the entered word is an identifier, i.e. whether it starts with an English letter in any case or 
    underscore and does not contain other characters except the letters of the English alphabet (in any case), 
    numbers and underscore.
    
7. [Remove extra spaces](strings/task7/task7.py)

    A line is entered that can have spaces at the beginning, at the end and between words of more 
    than one space. Bring it to a normalized form, i.e. remove all spaces at the beginning and end, and leave only
    one space between words.
