# Codesignal tasks: Regular expressions

1. [Check that the sentence is correct](is-sentence-correct.py). Sentence is considered correct if:
   
   - it starts with a capital letter;
   - it ends with a full stop, question mark or exclamation point ('.', '?' or '!');
   - full stops, question marks and exclamation points don't appear anywhere else in the sentence.
   
   Given a `sentence`, return `true` if it is correct and `false` otherwise.
