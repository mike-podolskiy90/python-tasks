# Codesignal tasks: Arrays

1. First duplicate: [solution 1](first-duplicate-1.py) [solution 2](first-duplicate-2.py)

    Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. 
    In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does. 
    If there are no such elements, return -1.

2. First not repeating character: [solution 1](first-not-repeating-character.py)

    Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. 
    If there is no such character, return '_'.

3. Rotate image: [solution 1](rotate-image-1.py)

    You are given an n x n 2D matrix that represents an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
    _Note: Try to solve this task in-place (with O(1) additional memory)._
